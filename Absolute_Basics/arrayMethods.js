/*
On the other hand, a map is an ordered list of
key/value pairs. While this sounds like an
object, there are some important differences.
For example, keys can be any value (not just strings)
in maps; you can easily find its  size, and its key/value
pairs can be filtered or modified in certain circumstances.
